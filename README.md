# Unity TimeScale Toolbar
 
Adds a slider to the main toolbar to quickly change Time.TimeScale.

## Getting Started
- Add from: Window > Package Manager > From git Url
> https://github.com/bl4sterino/Unity-TimeScale-Toolbar.git
- Configure from: Edit > Project Settings > TimeScale Toolbar

## Note
This includes the [Unity Toolbar Extender](https://github.com/marijnz/unity-toolbar-extender), if you already have it in your project you will need to remove it from this package.
Also, as the author stated:

> it's quite hacky as the code is relying on reflection to access Unity's internal code. It might not work anymore with a new Unity update but is proven to work up to (at least) Unity 2021.2.

It is working on 2022.3
